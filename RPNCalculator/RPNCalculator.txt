Introduction:

The RPN calculator receives user input in form of strings containing whitespace separated lists of numbers and operators.

Available operators are +, -, *, /, sqrt, clear, undo

+, -, *, and / are binary operators and it requires minimum two numbers for its operation on the top two items from the stack.. 

sqrt is singale operator operation and it requires minimum one number

undo will undo previous operation

clear will remove all items from the stacks.

If an operator cannot find a sufficient number of parameters on the stack, a warning is displayed:

operator <operator> (position: <pos>): insufficient parameters

Instruction: Programming done using Java Language implemented by TDD in Eclipse IDE.

Implementation Steps: 

1 A new class RPNStack is created which extends Generic Stack class to support Undo operation. 
  RPNSTackUnitTest.java file is included based on which RPNStack is created.
  
  New public Functions added: undo(), canUndo(). 
  Extended functions: push() and pop()

  class RPNStack File name : RPNStack.java
  Unit Test File name : RPNSTackUnitTest.java
  

2. RPNCalculator class is created which ensures RPN calculator computation for Binary Operation(+, -, *, /,), Unary operation(sqrt), undo and clear. Programming is done in extensible way than any new operations and functionality can be added without much change in the code.

   Public Functions : 
   processRPNStackOperation() -> Take String input and process for RPN Calculator Operation (+, -, *, /, sqrt, clear, undo)
   printRPNStack() -> print RPNStack as instructed
   getRPNStackElementAtIndex() -> It returns indexed element for RPNCalculator stack
   getRPNStackSize() -> return RPNCalculator stack size
   
   
   Protected Functions for further extension:
   rpnCalcBinaryOps() -> Java BiFunction to support Binary Operation (+, -, *, /,)
   rpnCalcUnaryOps() -> Java Function to support Unary Operation (sqrt)

   class RPNcalculator File name : RPNcalculator.java
   Unit Test File name : RPNcalculatorUnitTest.java

3.  RPNCalculatorMain class is created to have main() run it as Java application to take input from user and process input for RPN Calculator operation.

    Public Functions : 
    main() -> Main function to take input from users and process input for RPN Calculator operation and print output to the console.
